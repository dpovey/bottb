# Project Rules

See `AGENTS.md` for full guidelines. Key points:

## Before Any Edits

1. Check branch: `git branch --show-current`
2. If on main, create a worktree first (see `doc/agent/workflow.md`)
3. Exception: Trivial one-line fixes may go to main with user approval

## Pre-commit

Run all checks before committing:

```bash
pnpm format && pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm test
```

See `doc/agent/checklist.md` for the full Assess process.

## Commit Messages

Use conventional commits: `<type>: <description>`

Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore, perf, ci, build

## Key Documentation

- `DESIGN.md` - Design system and tokens
- `doc/arch/` - Architecture decisions
- `doc/practices/` - Coding standards
- `doc/requirements/` - Feature specs
