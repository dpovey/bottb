  "description": "With the movement expanding to Sydney for the first time, Brisbane's fourth Battle of the Tech Bands proved the original city still knew how to bring the noise. Four bands descended on The Triffid in Newstead, keeping the energy high and the competition fierce. Proudly supported by Jumbo Interactive, this event was the first half of BOTTB's biggest year yet — ten bands across two cities all raising money for Youngcare. In the end, Off The Record from For the Record claimed the Brisbane crown, setting the stage for Sydney's inaugural battle just weeks later.",
